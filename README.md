🕵️‍♂️ DEEPFAKE RECOGNITION
📖 Overview
DEEPFAKE RECOGNITION is designed to identify deepfake videos using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and ResNet (Residual Networks). This project aims to offer an accurate and reliable method for detecting manipulated media. 🎥🔍

🚀 Features
Deepfake Detection: Utilizes advanced LSTM and ResNet models for video analysis. 🤖
High Accuracy: Effective in distinguishing between real and synthetic content. ✅
User-Friendly: Easy-to-use interface for video processing and result display. 🌟
