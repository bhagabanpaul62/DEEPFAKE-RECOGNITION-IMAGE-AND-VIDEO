# DEEPFAKE-RECOGNITION
=======
🕵️‍♂️ DEEPFAKE RECOGNITION
📖 Overview
DEEPFAKE RECOGNITION is designed to identify deepfake videos using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and ResNet (Residual Networks). This project aims to offer an accurate and reliable method for detecting manipulated media. 🎥🔍

🚀 Features
Deepfake Detection: Utilizes advanced LSTM and ResNet models for video analysis. 🤖
High Accuracy: Effective in distinguishing between real and synthetic content. ✅
User-Friendly: Easy-to-use interface for video processing and result display. 🌟
📥 Installation
Clone the Repository: Run git clone https://github.com/bhagabanpaul62/DEEPFAKE-RECOGNITION.git and then cd DEEPFAKE-RECOGNITION.
Set Up a Virtual Environment: Use python -m venv venv and activate it with source venv/bin/activate (on Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate).
Install Dependencies: Execute pip install -r requirements.txt.
Download Pre-trained Models: Follow the instructions in models/README.md or download the model directly from Google Drive.
🛠️ Usage
Run the detection system with python detect_deepfake.py --video <path_to_video>. Replace <path_to_video> with the path to your video file.

⚙️ Configuration
Customize model settings in config.json. For more details, see docs/configuration.md.
