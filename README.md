🕵️‍♂️ DEEPFAKE RECOGNITION
📖 Overview
Welcome to DEEPFAKE RECOGNITION! This project is dedicated to identifying deepfake videos using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. By leveraging LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and ResNet (Residual Networks), we aim to provide an accurate and reliable system for detecting manipulated media. 🎥🔍

🚀 Features
Deepfake Detection: Detects manipulated videos using advanced LSTM and ResNet models. 🤖
High Accuracy: Achieves precise classification of real vs. synthetic content. ✅
User-Friendly: Simple interface for seamless video analysis and results display. 🌟
📥 Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/bhagabanpaul62/DEEPFAKE-RECOGNITION.git
cd DEEPFAKE-RECOGNITION
Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download Pre-trained Models

Follow the instructions in models/README.md to download the pre-trained models required for the detection system. 📥

🛠️ Usage
To run the deepfake detection system, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python detect_deepfake.py --video <path_to_video>
Replace <path_to_video> with the path to the video file you want to analyze. For example:

bash
Copy code
python detect_deepfake.py --video sample_video.mp4
⚙️ Configuration
You can customize model parameters and settings in the config.json file. For details, refer to docs/configuration.md. 🔧
