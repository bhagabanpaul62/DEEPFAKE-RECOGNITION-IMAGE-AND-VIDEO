🕵️‍♂️ DEEPFAKE RECOGNITION
📖 Overview
DEEPFAKE RECOGNITION is designed to identify deepfake videos using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and ResNet (Residual Networks). This project aims to offer an accurate and reliable method for detecting manipulated media. 🎥🔍

🚀 Features
Deepfake Detection: Utilizes advanced LSTM and ResNet models for video analysis. 🤖
High Accuracy: Effective in distinguishing between real and synthetic content. ✅
User-Friendly: Easy-to-use interface for video processing and result display. 🌟
📥 Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/bhagabanpaul62/DEEPFAKE-RECOGNITION.git cd DEEPFAKE-RECOGNITION

Set up a virtual environment: python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate (On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Download pre-trained models by following the instructions in models/README.md.

🛠️ Usage
Run the detection system with: python detect_deepfake.py --video <path_to_video>

Replace <path_to_video> with the path to your video file.

⚙️ Configuration
Customize model settings in config.json. For more details, see docs/configuration.md.
